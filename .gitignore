### Testing Artifacts (XC Tests / UI Tests) ###
# Test-specific build data, logs, and coverage reports
# While the main `build/` handles most, these are good specifics

*.xctestrun
*.profraw
*.profdata

### Environment Variables and Secrets ###
# IMPORTANT: Use this section to exclude files that store API keys,
# sensitive configurations, or environment-specific settings.

# General convention for environment files (customize these names!)
.env
.env.*
config/secrets.plist
config/api_keys.json
config/*.private.json

# A common pattern for storing secrets in an Xcode project:
# An auto-generated file that contains keys loaded at build time.
# Use this if you generate a config file from your .env file.
Secrets.swift
Configuration.swift

### Mac OS X and Editor Specific ###
.idea/      # JetBrains IDEs (e.g., AppCode)
